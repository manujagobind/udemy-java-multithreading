# Learning multi-threading in Java

Learning from [this Udemy course](https://www.udemy.com/course/java-multithreading-concurrency-performance-optimization/).

## Notes

- Need for multi-threading
  - Responsiveness via concurrency: servers able to server multiple requests at once, moving a mouse on a screen during video streaming displays playback controls
  - Performance: running tasks in paralell


- Single threaded Process vs Multi-threaded Process

- Performance in Multithreading

  - Latency: the time to completion of a task. Measured in time units.
  - Throughput: the amount of tasks completed in a given period. Measured in tasks/time unit.
